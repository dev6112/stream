# Images compression using unsupervised ML

This project is focused on applying PCA and clustering methods (mini batch K-means) to image compression problem.

`scikit-learn` implementations of both algorithms are used. More on how these methods can be used to compress images can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks/) directory. 

**Note:** Python >= 3.10 is required!

### Web application

Web application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
You can experiment and have fun on your own [here :fire:](https://unsupervised-ml-image-compression.streamlit.app/).

### Results

Below you can see an examplary output of using clustering for image compression.

|Original image | Compressed image with K = 10 | Compressed image with K = 50 |
|---| --- | ---|

### Running the application

Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.

* Python virtual environment

    1. Create a virtual environment (below named env) and activate it
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/Scripts/activate # bash
    env\Scripts\activate # on Windows
    ```
    2. Install required packages
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    3. Run the application
    ```bash
    streamlit run Main_page.py
    ```

Alternatilvely, if you have Make installed, you can use use command `make streamlit`.

* Docker

    1. Build docker image (named `my_app_image`)
    ```bash
    docker build -t my_app_image .
    ```
    2. Run the container
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 my_app_image
    ```
Alternatilvely, if you have Make installed, you can use use command `make docker-all`.
