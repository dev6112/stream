    This application enables to compress both RGB and grayscale images using unsupervised learning algorithms.
    These include mini-batch K-means, and PCA (principal component analysis).

    Select a subpage from sidebar, upload an image and have fun experienting! :fire:

    ## Example:
    Below you can see an result of applying clustering image compression to a picture of water drops.
    It is plain to see that the more clusters we use, the less compressed the image becomes.
